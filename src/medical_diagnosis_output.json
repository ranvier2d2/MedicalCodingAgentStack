  "explanation": "The codes suggested are specific to different types of migraines. G43.709 and G43.719 are for chronic migraines without aura, with the distinction of being intractable or not. G43.909 and G43.911 cover unspecified migraines, again distinguishing between intractable and non-intractable cases. G43.001 is for migraines without aura that are not intractable but have status migrainosus. These codes are relevant as they cover the severity and nature of the migraine described."
