      "description": "Diastolic (congestive) heart failure"

  ],
  "Similar Codes": [],
  "Reasoning": "The diagnosis 'Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction' corresponds to diastolic heart failure. The ICD-10 code I50.3 accurately captures this medical condition as it represents heart failure where the heart muscle contracts normally but the ventricles do not relax as they should, preserving ejection fraction.",
