  "similar_codes_explanation": "The primary ICD-10 code for COPD is J44.9, which covers chronic obstructive pulmonary disease when it is unspecified. If there is an acute lower respiratory infection present, J44.0 is used. For cases with an acute exacerbation, J44.1 is appropriate. J44.8 is used for other specified types of COPD, and J43.9 is relevant if emphysema is a component of the COPD diagnosis.",
