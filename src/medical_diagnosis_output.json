          "rationale": "This code is prioritized because 'severe migraine' may imply an intractable nature, meaning it does not respond well to typical treatment, which is often considered more severe. The term 'chronic' also suggests frequent reoccurrences which heighten severity."

          "code": "G43.119",
          "description": "Migraine without aura, intractable",
          "rationale": "This code is suggested due to the severity context, often linked with intractability, requiring intense management. The absence of aura narrows the classification further."

          "code": "G43.109",
          "description": "Migraine without aura, not intractable",

  "explanations": "The codes were chosen based on their relevance to the unspecified severity descriptor 'severe migraine'. Prioritization is largely influenced by the potential chronic and intractable nature of such migraines. G43.719 and G43.119 address intractable forms which align with typical severe cases. G43.109 offers a milder interpretation assuming non-refractory to treatment."
