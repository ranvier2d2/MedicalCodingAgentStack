# Multi-Session Implementation Issues

## Overview
This document captures the key learnings and implementation details for multi-session support with AgentOps in the AStack Crew project.

## Implementation Status

### 1. Session Management 
- **Multiple Session Support**: Successfully implemented and tested
  - Each task gets its own isolated session
  - Sessions are properly created and cleaned up
  - Concurrent operations work as expected

### 2. Event Recording 
- **Event Parameters**:
  ```python
  # Correct Event creation
  event = agentops.Event(
      event_type="test_event",
      returns="test result"
  )
  ```
  - Only `event_type` and `returns` are required
  - No additional metadata parameters needed

### 3. Agent Management 
- **Agent Creation**:
  - Proper UUID format required
  - Agents are successfully created within session context
  - Clean up happens automatically with session end

## Test Coverage

### Passing Tests 
1. **Basic Session Management**
   - Session creation and cleanup
   - Task workflow execution
   - Session isolation

2. **Event Recording**
   - Event creation with correct parameters
   - Event recording within session context
   - Error handling for invalid parameters

3. **Concurrent Operations**
   - Multiple sessions running in parallel
   - Async task execution
   - Session isolation during concurrent operations

4. **Error Handling**
   - Invalid agent ID handling
   - Event parameter validation
   - Session cleanup verification

### Test Infrastructure
- Using pytest with async support (pytest-asyncio)
- Custom markers for integration and concurrent tests
- Proper test isolation and cleanup

## Current Implementation

### Session Management
```python
def run_crew_task(task_id: str, inputs: Dict[str, Any]):
    session = agentops.start_session()
    try:
        # Task execution within session context
        agent_id = str(uuid4())
        session.create_agent("test_agent", agent_id)
        
        # Event recording
        event = agentops.Event(
            event_type="task_execution",
            returns=result
        )
        session.record(event)
        
    finally:
        # Proper cleanup
        session.end_session()
```

### Key Learnings

1. **Session Isolation**
   - Each task should have its own session
   - Sessions should be cleaned up after task completion
   - No need for global session tracking

2. **Event Recording**
   - Keep event creation simple
   - Only use required parameters
   - Events are automatically associated with current session

3. **Agent Management**
   - Use proper UUID format for agent IDs
   - Create agents within session context
   - No need for explicit agent cleanup

## Best Practices

1. **Session Handling**
   - Always use try/finally for session cleanup
   - Create new session for each task
   - Don't share sessions between tasks

2. **Event Recording**
   - Use minimal event parameters
   - Record events within session context
   - Handle recording errors gracefully

3. **Concurrent Operations**
   - Sessions are thread-safe
   - Can run multiple sessions in parallel
   - Each task should manage its own session

## Next Steps

1. **Production Readiness** 
   - [x] Comprehensive test coverage
   - [x] Proper error handling
   - [x] Session cleanup verification

2. **Documentation** 
   - [x] Updated API documentation
   - [x] Correct event parameters
   - [x] Best practices guide

3. **Monitoring**
   - [ ] Add session metrics
   - [ ] Track event recording success rates
   - [ ] Monitor concurrent session performance
